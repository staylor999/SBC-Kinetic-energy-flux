These Jupyter notebooks provide information for the calculations and figures described in the manuscript "Seasonal to interannual cross-scale energy transfer variability: observational insight from the Santa Barbara Channel," which is published in Geophysical Research Letters. The full citation is provided below. 
Separate Jupyter notebooks are provided that reproduce each figure in the paper. An additional file, "KE flux notebook," details the coarse-graining approach as well as the cross-scale kinetic energy flux calculations. In the latter file, certain portions are left blank so future users can update parameters for their own applications and link to where data is stored. The high-frequency radar velocity fields (2-km, hourly surface velocity) can be obtained from the Scripps server database; full details are provided in the GRL manuscript (also found here: https://hfrnet-tds.ucsd.edu/). 
Wind work calculations were completed using ERA5 reanalysis data as described in the Jupyter notebooks; information on how to access the ERA5 data is provided in the GRL manuscript (also found here:https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview
