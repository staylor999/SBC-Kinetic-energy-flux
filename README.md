These are the accompanying Jupyter notebooks for the manuscript "Seasonal to interannual cross-scale energy transfer variability: observational insight from the Santa Barbara Channel" by Taylor, Thompson, Klein, & Kachelein (2026).
There is a notebook detailing how to create each figure in the paper and an additional file "KE flux notebook" which details the coarse-graining approach to the KE flux calculations.
Some portions are left blank for the discretion of the user and because of the data available. 
The primary data used is the high-frequency radar velocity data obtained from the Scripps server database. In addition, any windwork calculations were completed using the ERA5 reanalysis data. This is described in the notebooks.
